## Mockup Screenshots

Below is a mockup image of the Luxury Shoes ecommerce application created using the "Am I Responsive" website.

## UX

- The design for Luxury Shoes was created as a series of wireframes covering mobile, tablet and desktop to determine the initial design and layout of the site.
- Luxury Shoes is designed to be simple and easy to navigate using standard user conventions for ecommerce websites.
- The applications display the homepage, product pages, product details pages, shopping basket and checkout confirmation.
- Toasts appear in the top right of the page to let the user know that they have 'added to bag', 'removed from bag' and 'updated the bag', as well as a shopping bag toast that shows the user the products in their bag as well as the cost.

### Colour Scheme

- I decided to go with a clean and crisp colour scheme with a white background using black as the main colour for text/icons and a taupe accent to provide a pop of colour to the screen. This colour complements the background image used on the homepage.
- The colours used are as follows:-

- `#ffffff` used for primary text and buttons.
- `#000000` used for the background and secondary text.
- `#8C7D75` used for banner, buttons and other details.

I have used CSS `:root` variables to easily update the global colour scheme by changing only one value, instead of everywhere in the CSS file.

```css
:root {
    --black: #000;
    --white: #fff;
    --taupe: #8C7D75;
}
```

### Typography

- I used the Google Fonts called 'Baskervville SC' and 'Raleway' for the Luxury Shoes website.

- [Baskervville SC](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Baskervville+SC) was used for the main text on the site such as the navbar.
- [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) was used for product, product/details and shopping bag pages.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used in the Luxury Shoes site.
